/* This structure should:
Structured Gym Regimen:
have a name.
a list of muscle groups that the exercise targets.
track how many repetitions (reps) are done in one go.
track how many sets, or rounds of repetitions, we should do.
tally up the total amount of reps.
*/

// Creating the Exercise Structure:
struct Exercise {
  var name: String
  var muscleGroups: [String]
  var reps: Int
  var sets: Int
  var totalReps: Int

  init(name: String, muscleGroups: [String], reps: Int, sets: Int) {
    self.name = name
    self.muscleGroups = muscleGroups
    self.reps = reps
    self.sets = sets
    self.totalReps = reps * sets
  }
}

// Adding Exercise Instances:
var pushUp = Exercise(name: "Push up", muscleGroups: ["Triceps", "Chest", "Shoulders"], reps: 10, sets: 3)
//print(pushUp)

//Creating The Regimen Structure:
struct Regimen{
  var dayOfWeek: String
  var exercises: [Exercise]

  init(dayOfWeek: String, exercises: [Exercise]) {
    self.dayOfWeek = dayOfWeek
    self.exercises = exercises
  }

//Forming an Exercise Plan:
  func printExercisePlan() {
    print("Today is \(self.dayOfWeek) and the plan is to: ")
    for exercise in self.exercises {
      print("Do \(exercise.sets) sets of \(exercise.reps) \(exercise.name)s")
      print("That's a total of \(exercise.totalReps) \(exercise.name)s")
    }
  }
}

var mondayRegimen = Regimen(dayOfWeek: "Monday", exercises: [pushUp])
print(mondayRegimen.printExercisePlan())



// Additional Challenges:

/*

Congratulations, you made your very own regimen using structures!

This project creates the basis of an app but itâ€™s not fully complete. You can customize it to your liking. If you want to challenge yourself further:

Create additional Exercise instances.
Create additional Regimen instances.
Add a mutating method to the Regimen structure to add exercises.
